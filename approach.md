Hi Folks!

The idea here is to give you more of an insight into what was the thinking while implementing this solution.

- Create a github repo.
- Create a basic rails app.
- Pull in our favourite unit testing library.
- Deploy to heroku.
- Need to go through the requirements and potentially create a todo list.
- Investigate other status pages.

- take it from there.
